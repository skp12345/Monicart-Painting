		<p class="card-text">I am from Indore Madhya Pradesh and living with my husband and a lovely daughter. I had opted fashion designing as an opportunity to build my career. I graduated from INIFD, Indore. Due to this course, I have been able to develop a lot of interest in my sketching. I have been able to excel at various levels that are best suited to my career and contribute to my best way possible.
	
	Now I am working as an art teacher in an international school with chain of branches across India. As an art teacher, I could get to know children from different backgrounds and promote their skills. I find the potential in each child and try to nurture them by giving them the maximum output and skill sets they need. Additionally trying to encourage and motivate those who exhibit innovation and creativity. <br>
